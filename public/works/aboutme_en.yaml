aboutme: |
  I love using computers to achieve:
  - Things that only humans could do
  - Things that humans could never do

  As a means to realize this, I am particularly interested in machine learning and programming language processing systems.

  My goal is to become a researcher and engineer who can handle both theory and implementation.

stack: |
  My primary choices of programming languages are Python, Julia, C++, and TypeScript.
  I also write Go and Scheme.

  However, I believe that each programming language and technology has its suitable use case.
  I don't have strong preferences for specific languages or libraries; I learn and use whatever is necessary for the situation.

detailed: 
 - Theorem Proving Systems
 - Automated Proof Generation
 - Implementation of Language Servers
