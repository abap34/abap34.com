aboutme: |
  I love using computers to achieve:

  - Things that only humans could do
  - Things that humans could never do

  As a means to realize this, I am particularly interested in machine learning and programming language processing systems.

  My goal is to become a researcher and engineer who can handle both theory and implementation.

stack: |
  I tend to have relatively good knowledge and motivation in areas related to machine learning and programming language processing systems.

  I also do web development as needed. (often using React and FastAPI)

  The languages I usually choose are Python, Julia, C++, and TypeScript.
  I also write in Go, C, and Scheme.

  However, I believe that there is a suitable programming language or technology for every situation,
  so I am not particularly attached to the languages or libraries I use, and I am the type who learns and uses them on the spot if necessary.

 - Theorem Proving Systems
 - Automated Proof Generation
 - Implementation of Language Servers
