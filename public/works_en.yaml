  short_desc: Extended Markdown Parser & Static Site Generator
  desc: |
    almo is an extended Markdown parser and static site generator.

    The core parser is implemented in C++ with a focus on performance, but it also provides Python bindings, making it accessible and extensible in Python.
    One of almo’s most unique features is the ability to execute Python files and generate plots in the browser using WebAssembly.

    Ultimately, the goal is to provide a useful writing environment for those interested in machine learning, numerical computing, and algorithms.
    Features such as VSCode integration and Jupyter Notebook conversion have also been implemented.

    This blog site is also built using almo.

    I am part of the development team, primarily responsible for the overall project design and implementation.

  short_desc: A presentation on pseudo-random number generation and parallel computing
  desc: |
    Pseudo-random number generation is essential in numerical computing and machine learning.
    At the same time, parallelization is critical for accelerating computations.

    However, naive parallelization can compromise the reproducibility of pseudo-random number generation.

    This presentation begins with the basics of pseudo-random numbers and parallel processing and then explores techniques for maintaining reproducibility in parallel execution.

    As a concrete example, it introduces how Julia manages the state of pseudo-random number generators in multi-process and multi-threaded environments.
